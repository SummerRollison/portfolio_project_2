                <p>High school yearbook class was where I discovered what it was to be lost in my work. I spent hundreds
                    of
                    hours in the corner classroom on an adrenaline high of creating. In the ten years since that first
                    taste
                    of excitement, Iâ€™ve been motivating, educating, and pushing myself to do more.</p>

                    <p>Summer is amazing! She was (and remains) my top design student. Summer worked with our
                        marketing team at Texas Tech University Hospitality Services for a year where she took the
                        initiative to continue to develop her skills. With her relentless motivation and desire to
                        learn,
                        Summer will bring a wealth of knowledge and skills to any organization that snags her!</p>

                    <p>Summer is a creative professional and driven individual. She is able to self motivate
                        and direct herself with very little direction or leadership needed to produce high end results.
                        She
                        is a team player that integrates well with everyone. If you give her a task that she has no
                        experience in she quickly dives into educating herself as she is as resourceful as they come.

                    <p>Summer is an exceptional team player. She is supportive to company initiatives and is
                        not afraid to share her ideas and creative perspective on a variety of topics. Summer works
                        quickly
                        and efficiently . If she doesn't know how to do something she will take the initiative to figure
                        it
                        out and produce a quality project or product every time. Summer is very professional in her
                        communication skills as well. I would recommend Summer to anyone who asks, specifically
                        identifying
                        her professionalism and creativity.</p>

                    <p>As my former supervisor, Summer Rollison led and managed the Marketing department with
                        grace and grit. She developed brand design standards and led efforts to build a Marketing plan
                        that
                        would drive results over the next years. The Marketing department would not have existed if she
                        had
                        not taken initiative to build it. She is incredibly driven. If you task her with something she
                        doesn't know much about, she will put forth every effort in learning and accomplishing that
                        task.
                        She inspires those around her to rise to the bar she sets, and encourages her teammates to be
                        their
                        best. I could not have asked for a better supervisor, and I'm grateful to have worked with such
                        an
                        extraordinary person. Summer will make an excellent addition to any team!</p>
